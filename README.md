# GPG-signing-key
You're seeing this error because your Kali Linux system is **missing a GPG signing key** required to verify the authenticity of packages from the `kali-rolling` repository. Specifically, it's missing this key:

```
827C8569F2518CC677FECA1AED65462EC8D5E4C5
```

### ‚úÖ To fix this, follow these steps to manually fetch and add the missing key:

---

### üõ† Step-by-Step Fix:

#### 1. Download the missing GPG key:

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kali-archive.gpg
```

> This will download the official Kali archive signing key and place it where APT can use it for verification.

---

#### 2. Clean your APT cache (optional but recommended):

```bash
sudo apt clean
```

---

#### 3. Update the package lists again:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

---

#### 4. (Optional) Upgrade your packages:

```bash
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

---

### üîç Why this happens:

* Kali rotates its GPG keys occasionally to enhance security.
* If your system has outdated keys (or a broken keyring), it will **fail to authenticate** the package lists and throw this error.

---

### ‚úÖ After following the above steps, the error should disappear, and your `apt update` will work without signature verification issues.

Let me know if you'd like to **verify the fingerprint** or troubleshoot further.
